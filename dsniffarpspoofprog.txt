Installed dsniff on Ubuntu VMs.

Activated Packet forwarding with: sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

Using arpspoof command and our target VM IP, we were able to record the ethernet packets in Wireshark which was running on another local vm.

This kali machine interpreted the spoofed MAC address as being correct, meaning that most likely everything on the network will be able to percieve our "hacking" 
ubuntu machine as having any MAC address we want.
