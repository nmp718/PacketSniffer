# Packet Sniffer

A versatile tool that allows you to monitor and manipulate network traffic, perform ARP/DNS spoofing, transmit data to remote devices, and hack WiFi networks.

## Features

- Intercept and collect network traffic 
- Modify and redirect web page requests 
- Perform ARP/DNS spoofing 
- Transmit data to attacker's remote device 
- WiFi hacking of other networks

## Spoofing

Spoofing is a technique where an attacker pretends to be someone else in a communication process by falsifying the data, usually by manipulating the sender's address. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or the ability to manipulate network traffic.

## [ARP and ARP Spoofing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_nDb-BGAxbo8LzDqBNAs2w8sAOuou_S5dgIwHan7hgw/edit)

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a network protocol that translates IP addresses into MAC (Media Access Control) addresses. ARP spoofing is an attack in which an attacker sends fake ARP messages to a local network, linking their MAC address with the IP address of another device (usually the gateway). This allows the attacker to intercept, modify, or even block data packets between the targeted device and the rest of the network.

## [DNS and DNS Spoofing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fIKGswlbdPqAqBK-22LJFlVeRwW1QIYDlC0ToQIdPQ4/edit)

DNS (Domain Name System) is a system used to translate human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers can understand. DNS spoofing, also known as DNS cache poisoning, is an attack where an attacker introduces false DNS records into the target's DNS resolver cache. This causes the target to visit a malicious website instead of the intended one, which can lead to phishing attacks or malware infection.

## [Proxy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UJ959FaMMCM5hwK4AZTSfN-IlLeY6JXYK1clymwnOW4/edit?usp=sharing)

A proxy server is an intermediary server that sits between a client and the destination server. It acts as a gateway, receiving requests from the client and forwarding them to the destination server. Proxies can be used for various purposes, such as bypassing network restrictions, providing anonymity, or enhancing security. They can also be used in attacks to intercept and manipulate network traffic.

## [Root Certificate](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QhGxZAonEqoXcohWwhv0ymqWjXpLTb6Xus5eSc645tU/edit#)

A root certificate is a digital certificate issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA) that serves as the anchor of trust in a public key infrastructure (PKI) system. When a secure connection (e.g., HTTPS) is established between a client and a server, the server provides a certificate that is signed by a CA. The client verifies the certificate against its list of trusted root certificates, ensuring the authenticity of the server.

In a security context, attackers can create a fake root certificate and install it on the target's device, enabling them to intercept and decrypt encrypted traffic or perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

## Conclusion

The Packet Sniffer is designed to perform all of the above-mentioned capabilities, making it an incredibly powerful and versatile tool for network monitoring and manipulation. Use it with caution and only for legal purposes.
